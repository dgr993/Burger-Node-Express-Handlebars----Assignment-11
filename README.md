# Node-Express-Handlebars---Assignment-11

made a website that allows the user to input a burger name then say if it is devoured or not. They can also delete a burger if they want to as well.

Hangups:

challenging to remember how to call my database references. As i had some parts that were the name of the columns and others that were variables but they seemed to mesh together.
It was also tricky to fit to tie each document together as this was the first assignment i had more than two folders or so.

Now it is finished and complete but i could add some css styling in the future to make it look more presentable
